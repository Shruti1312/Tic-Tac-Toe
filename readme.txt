Instructions on how to run minimax algorithm

//************************************************************//
For Sequential version, there is a folder named "Sequential"
//************************************************************//
1. Please go inside that folder, you will find a two files, one is Main.c and other one is makefile.
2. Makefile contains all the compile instruction. Running that will generate main.exe in the same location.
3. Run ./main.exe to run the program
4. On output you will see the Execution time, the input board and the output board state after running 


//************************************************************//
For parallelized version, there is a folder named "Sequential"
//************************************************************//
1. Please go inside that folder, you will find a two files, one is Main.c and other one is makefile.
2. Makefile contains all the compile instruction. Running that will generate main.exe in the same location.
3. The output exe "main.exe" take number of threads as in command line argument, so to run program use command ./main.exe [Num of thread]
4. On output you will see the Execution time, the input board and the output board state after running
